# Credit-Risk-Prediction
All the information and data is taken from the Hakathon mentioned
https://hack.univ.ai/problem/data  which ended at 20 April 2020

## Problem Statement
<p>An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product.
They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence when they
acquire new customers they want to predict who is more risky and who is not.
</p>

### What do you have to do?
You are required to use the training dataset to identify patterns that predict default. Apply the patterns on test dataset to identify “potential” defaulters.
